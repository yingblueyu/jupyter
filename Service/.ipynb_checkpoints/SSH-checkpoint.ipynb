    "### AUTHENTICATION\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenSSH SSH daemon supports SSH protocol 2 only. Each host has a host-specific key, used to identify the host. Whenever a client connects, the daemon responds with its public host key. The client compares the host key against its own database to verify that it has not changed. Forward secrecy is provided through a Diffie-Hellman key agreement. This key agreement results in a shared session key. The rest of the session is encrypted using a symmetric cipher. The client selects the encryption algorithm to use from those offered by the server. Additionally, session integrity is provided through a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the server and the client enter an authentication dialog. The client tries to authenticate itself using host-based authentication, public key authentication, challenge-response authentication, or password authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the client successfully authenticates itself, a dialog for preparing the session is entered. At this time the client may request things like allocating a pseudo-tty, forwarding X11 connections, forwarding TCP connections, or forwarding the authentication agent connection over the secure channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, the client either requests an interactive shell or execution or a non-interactive command, which `sshd` will execute via the user's shell using its `-c` option. The sides then enter session mode. In this mode, either side may send data at any time, and such data is forwarded to/from the shell or command on the server side, and the user terminal in the client side.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user program terminates and all forwarded X11 and other connections have been closed, the server sends command exit status to the client, and both sides exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LOGIN PROCESS\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user successfully logs in, `sshd` does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the login is on a tty, and no command has been specified, prints last login time and */etc/motd* (unless prevented in the configuration file or by *~/.hushlogin*; see the [FILES](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd#FILES) section).\n",
    "2. If the login is on a tty, records login time.\n",
    "3. Checks */etc/nologin*; if it exists, prints contents and quits (unless root).\n",
    "4. Changes to run with normal user privileges.\n",
    "5. Sets up basic environment.\n",
    "6. Reads the file *~/.ssh/environment*, if it exists, and users are allowed to change their environment. See the `PermitUserEnvironment` option in [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5).\n",
    "7. Changes to user's home directory.\n",
    "8. If *~/.ssh/rc* exists and the [sshd_config(5)](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config.5) `PermitUserRC` option is set, runs it; else if */etc/ssh/sshrc* exists, runs it; otherwise runs [xauth(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/xauth.1). The “rc” files are given the X11 authentication protocol and cookie in standard input. See [SSHRC](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd#SSHRC), below.\n",

    "\n",
    "If the file *~/.ssh/rc* exists, [sh(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/sh.1) runs it after reading the environment files but before starting the user's shell or command. It must not produce any output on stdout; stderr must be used instead. If X11 forwarding is in use, it will receive the \"proto cookie\" pair in its standard input (and `DISPLAY` in its environment). The script must call [xauth(1)](https://man.openbsd.org/xauth.1) because `sshd` will not run xauth automatically to add X11 cookies.\n",
